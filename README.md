# Unsupervised_classification
This research project, conducted as part of my coursework, delves into the application of unsupervised learning techniques for news classification. The primary focus is on developing a classification model without explicit labeled data, harnessing the power of unsupervised learning to automatically categorize news articles based on their content.
